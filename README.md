TaskDragon is a Home Assistant custom integration plus a dashboard card and sidebar panel. It keeps a household's lists in one SQLite file inside Home Assistant (`.storage/taskdragon.db`), exposes every shared plan as a native `todo.*` entity, and adds what plain to-do lists can't do: recurring chores with streaks, a shopping grid that merges quantities, a Mealie recipe browser and cooking view, an asset register with sensor-driven maintenance, a camera barcode scanner, and portable backups.

## Features

### Quick List and categories

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AftermathLK/taskdragon/main/docs/images/quick-list.webp" alt="The Quick List on desktop, and the category dropdown on a phone" width="100%"></p>

- The card opens on a zero-friction **Quick List**. Switch between the **shared household** list and **your private** one, file items into collapsible sections ("Calls to Make", "House Stuff"…), and type `Calls: dentist` to land straight in a section.
- **Promote** an item into any plan (shopping items get an aisle, packing items go to the next trip), or **Repeat it…** to turn it into a recurring chore.
- One **category dropdown** in the header shows where you are and how many items are open. Create categories with an icon and a behavior (quick list, chores, shopping grid, Kanban, trip packing, maintenance, pantry), and hide or reorder them per person.
- **Brain Dump**: type or say *"pick up 2x4s at Menards Saturday morning and add garlic powder to the grocery list"* and it becomes a project task plus a grocery item, using your Assist LLM when there is one and a built-in parser when there isn't.

### Chores, My Day and the family view

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AftermathLK/taskdragon/main/docs/images/family.webp" alt="Family split view with a column per person, and My Day on a phone" width="100%"></p>

- **Time-blocked chores** with calendar (RRULE) or rolling recurrence, streaks, and a rollover hour so late-night completions count for today.
- **My Day** for whoever is signed in, and a **family split** for a wall tablet: a column per person plus the up-for-grabs pool with one-tap **Claim**. "Last done by Sam yesterday at 6:15 PM" on every recurring chore.
- **Shift-aware chores** go each morning to whoever is off work, based on everyone's work calendar.
- **Snooze until context**: until a time, next time I'm home, when we're all home, this weekend if it's not raining, or when any entity reaches a state. **Blocking dependencies** keep Task B blocked (and optionally hidden) until Task A is done.

### Groceries and pantry

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AftermathLK/taskdragon/main/docs/images/groceries.webp" alt="Aisle-grouped shopping tiles, and the pantry drawer after scanning an item" width="100%"></p>

- A compact **aisle grid** (Produce, Meat, Dairy, Spices/Pantry…) that merges duplicates and units, with a frequently-bought drawer.
- A **pantry** with In stock / Low / Out. Going low can push the item (or a batch recipe's raw ingredients) to the list, or create a "make a new batch" chore.
- **Two-way Mealie shopping-list sync**: adds, check-offs, edits and deletes propagate both ways.

### Mealie recipe browser

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AftermathLK/taskdragon/main/docs/images/recipes.webp" alt="Mealie recipe browser with photos, filters and one-tap actions" width="100%"></p>

- Every Mealie recipe with its photo, categories, time and how often you cooked it. Filter by category or tag, sort, and search.
- **Add ingredients** skips seasonings and anything your pantry has in stock: *"Added 6 items from Chicken Sausage Orzo (Skipped 4 seasonings/pantry items)"*. **Review** lets you choose, and **Plan meal** puts it on Mealie's meal plan.
- The ignored-seasonings list is yours to edit, and Mealie foods labelled as spices are ignored automatically.
- Meal plans drive **prep timelines** (thaw T-36h, smoker T-4h…), **cook** tasks and **leftover** reminders with a countdown.

### Cooking view

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AftermathLK/taskdragon/main/docs/images/cooking-view.webp" alt="Full-screen cooking view with keep-screen-on, batch size, ingredients, steps and a running timer" width="100%"></p>

- Open any recipe full screen, readable from across the counter. **Keep screen on while viewing** holds a wake lock and takes it back when you return to the app.
- A **½× to 3× batch multiplier** rescales every amount (1½ cups, ⅔ tsp), ingredients strike through as you measure, and the current step is highlighted.
- Times in the instructions become **Start 15m timer** buttons. Timers keep running in a bar at the bottom and ring, vibrate and show a message when done.
- **Add missing ingredients to Groceries** adds what isn't in the pantry, at the current batch size.

### Barcode scanner

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AftermathLK/taskdragon/main/docs/images/barcode-scanner.webp" alt="Scanning a salt bag, using or restocking the part, and linking a new barcode" width="100%"></p>

- Scan from the header, the pantry, or a maintenance object's parts. The camera opens with a framing guide, **flashlight** and **camera switch**, and turns off the moment a code is read.
- **Parts**: one tap for **−1 Use part** (which re-orders when stock runs low), or **Restock** with +1 / +2 / +4 / +6. **Pantry**: a scan marks the item In Stock so recipe imports skip it.
- **New barcodes** are linked in one tap, with the product name suggested by Open Food Facts. Several brands can share one part.
- Works on Android with the built-in barcode reader and on iPhone, the iOS Companion app and desktops with a bundled ZXing reader, so no internet access is needed.

### Home maintenance and assets

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AftermathLK/taskdragon/main/docs/images/maintenance.webp" alt="Maintenance dashboard with status, progress and actions, and a water softener's salt gauge" width="100%"></p>

- Every appliance, system or vehicle is an **object** (`#3`) with **tasks** (`#3.1`), a parts inventory, manuals and invoices, and a full service history.
- Tasks fall due on **rolling or planned intervals**, seasonal windows, or **sensor triggers**: thresholds, counters (gallons, miles, kWh), runtime hours, cycle counts and leak sensors. Feedback (*too early / just right / too late*) teaches TaskDragon a better interval.
- Complete by tapping, scanning an **NFC tag** at the appliance, or a printed **QR code**. Print a **PDF service record** for any date range.
- A **water softener** with a water meter gets a live salt estimate: level, gallons and days until refill, learned from what you see in the tank.

### Projects and trip packing

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AftermathLK/taskdragon/main/docs/images/packing-projects.webp" alt="Projects Kanban board, and a trip packing list on a phone" width="100%"></p>

- **Projects** switch between a Kanban board and a dependency tree, with a bill of materials that can be pushed to the hardware list.
- **Trips** are dated and grouped (Clothes, Toiletries, Tech…), with a live "18 / 24 packed" bar. Items flagged *repeatable* start fresh on every new trip.

### Backups and the standalone bridge

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AftermathLK/taskdragon/main/docs/images/backups.webp" alt="Settings and backups: download, snapshots, schedule and restore" width="100%"></p>

- **Download a portable backup** (`.zip`) with the database, a plain-JSON dump of every table, every uploaded document and a checksum manifest.
- **Daily snapshots** at 03:15 into `/config/backups/taskdragon/` (the last 14 are kept), plus the `taskdragon.create_backup` service for automations.
- **Restore** with *Merge import* or *Full replace*. Checksums and the schema are verified, and a safety snapshot is taken first.
- The manifest maps every person and every Home Assistant entity, tag and service TaskDragon uses to portable ids, enough to move TaskDragon to a standalone app later.

### Light and dark

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AftermathLK/taskdragon/main/docs/images/dark-mode.webp" alt="TaskDragon following a dark Home Assistant theme" width="100%"></p>

The card uses your Home Assistant theme's colors, so it follows light, dark and custom themes.

## Install

### HACS (recommended)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open this repository in HACS.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=AftermathLK&repository=taskdragon&category=integration)

1. Click the button above, or in HACS open **⋮ → Custom repositories**, add `https://github.com/AftermathLK/taskdragon` with type **Integration**.
2. Find **TaskDragon** in HACS and **Download** it.
3. **Restart Home Assistant.** The Python requirements (`aiosqlite`, `python-dateutil`) install automatically.

### Manual

1. Download this repository and copy `custom_components/taskdragon` into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` folder.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

### Requirements

- Home Assistant **2024.11** or newer (Core, Container, OS or Supervised; nothing else to install).
- Optional: [Mealie](https://mealie.io/) v1 or v2 for recipes, meal plans and shopping sync.
- For the barcode scanner, Home Assistant must be reached over **HTTPS** (or through the Companion app), because browsers only allow the camera on secure pages.

### Coming from OmniPlan?

TaskDragon is the new name of the integration previously published as OmniPlan. The repository moved from `AftermathLK/omniplan` to `AftermathLK/taskdragon`, and the old address redirects here. Nothing is lost when you switch:

1. Install TaskDragon (above) and restart. On its first start TaskDragon copies the old database (lists, maintenance history, barcodes, settings) and the uploaded documents into its own files. The old ones are left untouched.
2. **Add integration → TaskDragon** offers to **import your existing setup** (people, schedule and Mealie connection) in one step.
3. Update what refers to the old name:
   - automations and scripts: `omniplan.*` services become `taskdragon.*`, and `omniplan_*` events become `taskdragon_*`;
   - to-do entities are recreated as `todo.taskdragon_*`;
   - dashboards: change `type: custom:omniplan-card` to `custom:taskdragon-card` (old cards keep working meanwhile);
   - the sidebar panel moves to `/taskdragon`. Printed QR labels that point at `/omniplan` keep opening the right item.
4. Remove OmniPlan: **Settings → Devices & services → OmniPlan → Delete**, then remove it in HACS.

Old portable backups (`/config/backups/omniplan/`) restore through **Upload & restore**.

## Ten-minute setup

1. **Add the integration.**

   [![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up TaskDragon.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=taskdragon)

   Or go to **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration → TaskDragon**, then walk through:
   - **Household**: your `person.*` entities, a `weather.*` entity, and optionally an Assist agent for Brain Dump.
   - **Work shifts**: per person, an optional work calendar and shift keywords for shift-aware chores.
   - **Mealie** (optional): URL and API token (Mealie → Profile → API Tokens). TaskDragon tests them before saving and never sends the token to the browser.
   - **Schedule**: rollover hour, shift and weekend-weather check times, meal times, leftovers, prep rules and the sidebar panel.
2. **Link people to users.** In **Settings → People**, link each household member's person to their Home Assistant user, so My Day, Claim and "Last done by" know who is who.
3. **Open TaskDragon.** Use the **TaskDragon** sidebar panel, or add the card to a dashboard (it's in the card picker; no resource to add). TaskDragon starts with Quick List, Daily Chores, Groceries, Hardware, Projects, Home Maintenance, Trip Packing and Pantry & Spices.
4. **Try it.**
   - Type into the Brain Dump bar: *"call the dentist tomorrow and add milk to groceries"*.
   - In **Groceries → Browse Mealie Recipes**, tap a recipe's photo to cook, or **Add ingredients**.
   - In **Home Maintenance**, start from a template (furnace, water softener, smoke detectors…) with **+ Add ▾**.
   - Tap the barcode button in the header and scan something in your pantry.
5. **Protect it.** Under **⋮ → Settings & backups**, download a portable backup and check the daily snapshot schedule.

The [user guide](docs/GUIDE.md) walks through every screen.

## Card configuration

The card's JavaScript is served and registered automatically. Add it from the card picker ("TaskDragon") or in YAML:

```yaml
# Opens on the Quick List (the default)
type: custom:taskdragon-card
view_mode: quick       # quick | auto | personal | kiosk_split
```

```yaml
# Phone / Companion app: opens on "My Day" for whoever is logged in
type: custom:taskdragon-card
view_mode: auto
```

```yaml
# Wall tablet: family split view
type: custom:taskdragon-card
view_mode: kiosk_split
title: Today
```

```yaml
# One plan only, no category dropdown (e.g. the grocery list on the fridge tablet)
type: custom:taskdragon-card
plan: Groceries        # plan name or id
```

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `view_mode` | `quick` | `quick` opens on the Quick List, `personal` on My Day, `kiosk_split` on the family split, and `auto` picks personal when your user is linked to a person. |
| `plan` | none | Show one plan only (name or id). |
| `plans` | all | Plan names or ids to offer in the category dropdown. |
| `person` | your person | Force whose My Day is shown. |
| `title` | `TaskDragon` | Card title. |
| `show_brain_dump` | `true` | Show the Brain Dump bar and microphone. |

## Privacy and security

- **Local-first.** Data stays in Home Assistant. The only outside calls are the ones you set up: your Mealie server, and Open Food Facts for unknown barcodes (barcode number only; an administrator can turn it off).
- **Private lists are filtered on the server.** Every command checks each id against the signed-in user, and other people's private items answer exactly like items that don't exist. Private lists get no `todo.*` entity.
- **Secrets stay on the server.** The Mealie token never reaches the browser; recipe photos come through an authenticated proxy.
- **Escape-by-default rendering** with an allow-list sanitizer, parameterized SQL everywhere, server-side undo tokens, and administrator-only backups and household settings.

Details are in the [reference](docs/REFERENCE.md#privacy--security).

## Development

```bash
pip install -r requirements_test.txt
pytest tests          # pure logic, no Home Assistant needed
pytest tests_ha       # end-to-end against a real Home Assistant core
```

See the [reference](docs/REFERENCE.md#development) for the module map.
